Description: The SPARRA risk score (Scottish Patients At Risk of admission and Re-Admission) estimates yearly risk of emergency hospital admission using electronic health records on a monthly basis for most of the Scottish population. This package implements a suite of functions used to analyse the behaviour and performance of the score, focusing particularly on differential performance over demographically-defined groups. It includes useful utility functions to plot receiver-operator-characteristic, precision-recall and calibration curves, draw stock human figures, estimate counterfactual quantities without the need to re-compute risk scores, to simulate a semi-realistic dataset.
